Problem 1.8
Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another.
Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring 
(i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).
Ans: append the original string to itself then call isSubstring. isSubstring method can be efficiently implemented using KMP.
